# SQL-labs
SQL Homework Submission

- Please submit your answers to SQL labs here (Section 2 and Section 7 questions). 
- Upload a .sql or .txt file following the format <first_name>_<last_name>_sql_solution.sql (e.g. Ben_Arayathel_sql) and submit it to your own git branch ( e.g. Ben_Arayathel_Branch).

# How do I create my own branch and submit my assignment? 

1. First we clone this repository locally in our systems. 
2. Next we navigate into our local git folder using git bash or terminal of our choice. 
3. Execute the command "git checkout -b Ben_Arayathel_Branch" 
	- This will create a new branch with the name "Ben Arayathel_Branch 
	- If a branch already exists, remove "-b" from the statement; "git checkout Ben_Arayathel_Branch". This will simply switch you to the existing branch.
	
4. Now you can make local changes, like adding your assignment file. 
5. Add the changes, commit those changes and push to GitHub.
